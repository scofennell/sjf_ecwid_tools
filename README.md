Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

= The plugin won't work.  Why? =
Make sure you have an ecwid store with an account that allows API access.  This may mean you need a paid ecwid account.

= Does this plugin makes me site really slow? =
Only for one page load.  It calls Ecwid, gets your store data, and saves it locally for future use.

= A cache?  What if I make changes to my products in Ecwid.com? =
You'll need to dump your cached data in order to see those changes.  There are three ways to do that:
1. Wait a few hours.  The cache resets each day.
2. Click the button to dump your cache in the plugin settings page.
3. Save or re-save any widget from this plugin. 

= The accordion widget shows some products multiple times.  This is dumb. =
It loops through all your categories, and shows all the products in each category.  If a product is in multiple categories, it will appear multiple times.

= Some of these widgets don't do exactly what I want them to do. Can you change something? =
Probably!  Contact me at scofennell@gmail.com to inquire about custom work.
